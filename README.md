Empowering the Development of Genomics Expertise (EDGE)
===================

EDGE is a highly adaptable bioinformatics platform that allows laboratories to quickly analyze and interpret genomic sequence data. The platform allows users to address a wide range of use cases including assay validation and the characterization of novel biological threats, clinical samples, and complex environmental samples.

To run EDGE, go to https://bioedge.lanl.gov/edge_ui/
